# Project Movies

The goal for this project was to use [themoviedb.org](http://themoviedb.org/)'s API to fetch a list of movies (more on which movies further down), display them on a page, and then link to a movie detail page when you click on the movie.

In this app, we've used the API to fetch popular movies in the US. 

We built the app together pair programming.

## The problem

At the beginning we had a few issues getting the APIs to display on the page. It was the first time we used styled components. After deploying we got an error when refreshing the page.
